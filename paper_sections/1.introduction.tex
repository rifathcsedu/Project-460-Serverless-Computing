%what is serverless?

Nowadays, Serverless Computing is becoming a popular technology.  It is a system that provides backend services on an as-used basis.
It also provides users to write and deploy code without worrying about the underlying support. It also handles all the system administration operations to make programmers' life more comfortable. If users use serverless technology for backend services, the user needs to pay based on their usage. They do not need to pay a fixed amount of bandwidth or number of servers because the service is autoscaling \cite{shafiei2019serverless,wu2020}. Note that though the name is serverless, physical servers are still needed, but the developers do not need to be aware of it. \reffig{fig:serverless} shows the transformation of services from physical machines to Serverless.
